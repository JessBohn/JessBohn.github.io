	<h3>My fan story</h3>
	<p>
		Hello, my name is Jessica and I remember watching <i>Revenge of the Nerds</i> for the first time with my father and I have loved it ever since. While some people like this film purely for its comedic content, I enjoy it because I connected to the story on a personal level. I self-identify as a nerd and have always felt like a bit of an outside, but through this movie I realized that I have my very own group of people to connect with. However, I am also a women in the engineering industry which created a new social challenge for me in college. This was until I found the real-life version of Lambda Lambda Lambda known as Phi Sigma Rho which is a sorority specifically for women in engineering and computer science. I became a national member of Phi Sigma Rho, because it was founded on the basis that the women in engineering were underrepresented in the Greek community that they too wanted to partake in. <aside>Phi Sigma Rho was founded in 1984, the same year that <i>Revenge of the Nerds</i> was released</aside>
